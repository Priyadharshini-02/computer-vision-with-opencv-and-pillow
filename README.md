# 🧠 Computer Vision with OpenCV and Pillow

This repository contains my hands-on practice and project notebooks.  
It covers the fundamentals of digital image representation, manipulation, enhancement, and transformation using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Pillow**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Computer Vision is the field of enabling machines to “see” and understand images.  
This project explores essential image processing operations — from pixel-level transformations to spatial filtering and geometric manipulation.
